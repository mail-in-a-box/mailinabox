	# no connection is made. We're just seeing how the box
	# would connect to it. There many be multiple IP addresses
	# assigned to an interface. `ip route get` reports the
	# preferred. That's good enough for us. See issue #121.

	# With IPv6, the best route may be via an interface that
	# only has a link-local address (fe80::*). These addresses
	# are only unique to an interface and so need an explicit
	# interface specification in order to use them with bind().
	# In these cases, we append "%interface" to the address.
