# User Authentication and Destination Validation
# ----------------------------------------------
#
# This script configures user authentication for Dovecot
# and Postfix (which relies on Dovecot) and destination
# validation by querying an Sqlite3 database of mail users.

source setup/functions.sh # load our functions
source /etc/mailinabox.conf # load global vars

# ### User and Alias Database

# The database of mail users (i.e. authenticated users, who have mailboxes)
# and aliases (forwarders).

db_path=$STORAGE_ROOT/mail/users.sqlite

# Create an empty database if it doesn't yet exist.
if [ ! -f "$db_path" ]; then
	echo "Creating new user database: $db_path";
	echo "CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, password TEXT NOT NULL, extra, privileges TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '');" | sqlite3 "$db_path";
	echo "CREATE TABLE aliases (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, source TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, destination TEXT NOT NULL, permitted_senders TEXT);" | sqlite3 "$db_path";
	echo "CREATE TABLE mfa (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, user_id INTEGER NOT NULL, type TEXT NOT NULL, secret TEXT NOT NULL, mru_token TEXT, label TEXT, FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE);" | sqlite3 "$db_path";
	echo "CREATE TABLE auto_aliases (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, source TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, destination TEXT NOT NULL, permitted_senders TEXT);" | sqlite3 "$db_path";

    group = postfix
  }
}
EOF

# And have Postfix use that service. We *disable* it here
# so that authentication is not permitted on port 25 (which
# does not run DKIM on relayed mail, so outbound mail isn't
# correct, see #830), but we enable it specifically for the
# submission port.

# ### Sender Validation

# We use Postfix's reject_authenticated_sender_login_mismatch filter to
# prevent intra-domain spoofing by logged in but untrusted users in outbound
# email. In all outbound mail (the sender has authenticated), the MAIL FROM
# address (aka envelope or return path address) must be "owned" by the user
# who authenticated. An SQL query will find who are the owners of any given
# address.
tools/editconf.py /etc/postfix/main.cf \
	smtpd_sender_login_maps=sqlite:/etc/postfix/sender-login-maps.cf

# Postfix will query the exact address first, where the priority will be alias
# records first, then user records. If there are no matches for the exact
# address, then Postfix will query just the domain part, which we call
# catch-alls and domain aliases. A NULL permitted_senders column means to
# take the value from the destination column.

EOF

# ### Destination Validation

# Use a Sqlite3 database to check whether a destination email address exists,
# and to perform any email alias rewrites in Postfix. Additionally, we disable
# SMTPUTF8 because Dovecot's LMTP server that delivers mail to inboxes does
# not support it, and if a message is received with the SMTPUTF8 flag it will
# bounce.

# SQL statement to rewrite an email address if an alias is present.
#
# Postfix makes multiple queries for each incoming mail. It first
# queries the whole email address, then just the user part in certain
# locally-directed cases (but we don't use this), then just `@`+the
# domain part. The first query that returns something wins. See
# http://www.postfix.org/virtual.5.html.
#
# virtual-alias-maps has precedence over virtual-mailbox-maps, but
# we don't want catch-alls and domain aliases to catch mail for users
# that have been defined on those domains. To fix this, we not only
# query the aliases table but also the users table when resolving
# aliases, i.e. we turn users into aliases from themselves to
# themselves. That means users will match in postfix's first query
# before postfix gets to the third query for catch-alls/domain alises.
#
# If there is both an alias and a user for the same address either
# might be returned by the UNION, so the whole query is wrapped in
# another select that prioritizes the alias definition to preserve
# postfix's preference for aliases for whole email addresses.
#
# Since we might have alias records with an empty destination because
# it might have just permitted_senders, skip any records with an
# empty destination here so that other lower priority rules might match.
cat > /etc/postfix/virtual-alias-maps.cf << EOF;
