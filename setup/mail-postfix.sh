# Postfix (SMTP)
# --------------
#
# Postfix handles the transmission of email between servers
# using the SMTP protocol. It is a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA).
#
# Postfix listens on port 25 (SMTP) for incoming mail from
# other servers on the Internet. It is responsible for very
# basic email filtering such as by IP address and greylisting,
# it checks that the destination address is valid, rewrites
# destinations according to aliases, and passses email on to
# another service for local mail delivery.
#
# The first hop in local mail delivery is to spampd via
# LMTP. spampd then passes mail over to Dovecot for
# storage in the user's mailbox.
#
# Postfix also listens on ports 465/587 (SMTPS, SMTP+STARTLS) for
# connections from users who can authenticate and then sends
# their email out to the outside world. Postfix queries Dovecot
# to authenticate users.
#
# Address validation, alias rewriting, and user authentication
# is configured in a separate setup script mail-users.sh
# because of the overlap of this part with the Dovecot
# configuration.

source setup/functions.sh # load our functions
source /etc/mailinabox.conf # load global vars

# ### Install packages.

# Install postfix's packages.
#
# * `postfix`: The SMTP server.
# * `postfix-pcre`: Enables header filtering.
# * `postgrey`: A mail policy service that soft-rejects mail the first time
#   it is received. Spammers don't usually try again. Legitimate mail
#   always will.
# * `ca-certificates`: A trust store used to squelch postfix warnings about
#   untrusted opportunistically-encrypted connections.
echo "Installing Postfix (SMTP server)..."
apt_install postfix postfix-sqlite postfix-pcre postgrey ca-certificates

# ### Basic Settings

# Set some basic settings...
#
# * Have postfix listen on all network interfaces.
# * Make outgoing connections on a particular interface (if multihomed) so that SPF passes on the receiving side.
# * Set our name (the Debian default seems to be "localhost" but make it our hostname).
# * Set the name of the local machine to localhost, which means xxx@localhost is delivered locally, although we don't use it.
# * Set the SMTP banner (which must have the hostname first, then anything).

	mydestination=localhost

# Tweak some queue settings:
# * Inform users when their e-mail delivery is delayed more than 3 hours (default is not to warn).
# * Stop trying to send an undeliverable e-mail after 2 days (instead of 5), and for bounce messages just try for 1 day.

# Guard against SMTP smuggling
# This "long-term" fix is recommended at https://www.postfix.org/smtp-smuggling.html.
# This beecame supported in a backported fix in package version 3.6.4-1ubuntu1.3. It is
# unnecessary in Postfix 3.9+ where this is the default. The "short-term" workarounds
# that we previously had are reverted to postfix defaults (though smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords
# was never included in a released version of Mail-in-a-Box).

# ### Outgoing Mail

# Enable the 'submission' ports 465 and 587 and tweak their settings.
#
# * Enable authentication. It's disabled globally so that it is disabled on port 25,
#   so we need to explicitly enable it here.
# * Do not add the OpenDMAC Authentication-Results header. That should only be added
#   on incoming mail. Omit the OpenDMARC milter by re-setting smtpd_milters to the
#   OpenDKIM milter only. See dkim.sh.
# * Even though we dont allow auth over non-TLS connections (smtpd_tls_auth_only below, and without auth the client cant
#   send outbound mail), don't allow non-TLS mail submission on this port anyway to prevent accidental misconfiguration.
#   Setting smtpd_tls_security_level=encrypt also triggers the use of the 'mandatory' settings below (but this is ignored with smtpd_tls_wrappermode=yes.)
# * Give it a different name in syslog to distinguish it from the port 25 smtpd server.
# * Add a new cleanup service specific to the submission service ('authclean')
#   that filters out privacy-sensitive headers on mail being sent out by
#   authenticated users.  By default Postfix also applies this to attached
#   emails but we turn this off by setting nested_header_checks empty.

# Enable TLS on incoming connections. It is not required on port 25, allowing for opportunistic
# encryption. On ports 465 and 587 it is mandatory (see above). Shared and non-shared settings are
# given here. Shared settings include:
# * Require TLS before a user is allowed to authenticate.
# * Set the path to the server TLS certificate and 2048-bit DH parameters for old DH ciphers.
# For port 25 only:
# * Disable extremely old versions of TLS and extremely unsafe ciphers, but some mail servers out in
#   the world are very far behind and if we disable too much, they may not be able to use TLS and
#   won't fall back to cleartext. So we don't disable too much. smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers applies to
#   both port 25 and port 587, but because we override the cipher list for both, it probably isn't used.

# ### DANE

# When connecting to remote SMTP servers, prefer TLS and use DANE if available.
#
# Preferring ("opportunistic") TLS means Postfix will use TLS if the remote end
# offers it, otherwise it will transmit the message in the clear. Postfix will
# accept whatever SSL certificate the remote end provides. Opportunistic TLS
# protects against passive easvesdropping (but not man-in-the-middle attacks).
# Since we'd rather have poor encryption than none at all, we use Mozilla's
# "Old" recommendations at https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/#server=postfix&server-version=3.3.0&config=old&openssl-version=1.1.1
# for opportunistic encryption but "Intermediate" recommendations when DANE
# is used (see next and above). The cipher lists are set above.

# DANE takes this a step further:
# Postfix queries DNS for the TLSA record on the destination MX host. If no TLSA records are found,
# then opportunistic TLS is used. Otherwise the server certificate must match the TLSA records
# or else the mail bounces. TLSA also requires DNSSEC on the MX host. Postfix doesn't do DNSSEC
# itself but assumes the system's nameserver does and reports DNSSEC status. Thus this also
# relies on our local DNS server (see system.sh) and `smtp_dns_support_level=dnssec`.
#
# The `smtp_tls_CAfile` is superfluous, but it eliminates warnings in the logs about untrusted certs,
# which we don't care about seeing because Postfix is doing opportunistic TLS anyway. Better to encrypt,
# even if we don't know if it's to the right party, than to not encrypt at all. Instead we'll
# now see notices about trusted certs. The CA file is provided by the package `ca-certificates`.

# ### Incoming Mail

# Pass mail to spampd, which acts as the local delivery agent (LDA),
# which then passes the mail over to the Dovecot LMTP server after.
# spampd runs on port 10025 by default.
#
# In a basic setup we would pass mail directly to Dovecot by setting
# virtual_transport to `lmtp:unix:private/dovecot-lmtp`.

# Who can send mail to us? Some basic filters.
#
# * `reject_non_fqdn_sender`: Reject not-nice-looking return paths.
# * `reject_unknown_sender_domain`: Reject return paths with invalid domains.
# * `reject_authenticated_sender_login_mismatch`: Reject if mail FROM address does not match the client SASL login
# * `reject_rhsbl_sender`: Reject return paths that use blacklisted domains.
# * `permit_sasl_authenticated`: Authenticated users (i.e. on port 587) can skip further checks.
# * `permit_mynetworks`: Mail that originates locally can skip further checks.
# * `reject_rbl_client`: Reject connections from IP addresses blacklisted in zen.spamhaus.org
# * `reject_unlisted_recipient`: Although Postfix will reject mail to unknown recipients, it's nicer to reject such mail ahead of greylisting rather than after.
# * `check_policy_service`: Apply greylisting using postgrey.
#
# Note the spamhaus rbl return codes are taken into account as advised here: https://docs.spamhaus.com/datasets/docs/source/40-real-world-usage/PublicMirrors/MTAs/020-Postfix.html
# Notes: #NODOC
# permit_dnswl_client can pass through mail from whitelisted IP addresses, which would be good to put before greylisting #NODOC
# so these IPs get mail delivered quickly. But when an IP is not listed in the permit_dnswl_client list (i.e. it is not #NODOC
# whitelisted) then postfix does a DEFER_IF_REJECT, which results in all "unknown user" sorts of messages turning into #NODOC
# "450 4.7.1 Client host rejected: Service unavailable". This is a retry code, so the mail doesn't properly bounce. #NODOC

# including dbdir. This is due to the way the init script sources the

# (luckily $STORAGE_ROOT does not currently work with spaces), or it needs to be a
