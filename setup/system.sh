# Basic System Configuration
# -------------------------

# ### Set hostname of the box

# If the hostname is not correctly resolvable sudo can't be used. This will result in
# errors during the install
#
# First set the hostname in the configuration file, then activate the setting

echo "$PRIMARY_HOSTNAME" > /etc/hostname
hostname "$PRIMARY_HOSTNAME"

# ### Fix permissions

# The default Ubuntu Bionic image on Scaleway throws warnings during setup about incorrect
# permissions (group writeable) set on the following directories.

chmod g-w /etc /etc/default /usr

# ### Add swap space to the system

# If the physical memory of the system is below 2GB it is wise to create a
# swap file. This will make the system more resiliant to memory spikes and
# prevent for instance spam filtering from crashing

# We will create a 1G file, this should be a good balance between disk usage
# and buffers for the system. We will only allocate this file if there is more
# than 5GB of disk space available

# The following checks are performed:
# - Check if swap is currently mountend by looking at /proc/swaps
# - Check if the user intents to activate swap on next boot by checking fstab entries.
# - Check if a swapfile already exists
# - Check if the root file system is not btrfs, might be an incompatible version with
#   swapfiles. User should handle it them selves.
# - Check the memory requirements
# - Check available diskspace

# See https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-on-ubuntu-14-04
# for reference

# Stock PHP is now 8.1, but we're transitioning through 8.0 because
# of Nextcloud.

# ### Update Packages

# Update system packages to make sure we have the latest upstream versions
# of things from Ubuntu, as well as the directory of packages provide by the
# PPAs so we can install those packages later.

# ### Install System Packages

# Install basic utilities.
#
# * unattended-upgrades: Apt tool to install security updates automatically.
# * cron: Runs background processes periodically.
# * ntp: keeps the system time correct
# * fail2ban: scans log files for repeated failed login attempts and blocks the remote IP at the firewall
# * netcat-openbsd: `nc` command line networking tool
# * git: we install some things directly from github
# * sudo: allows privileged users to execute commands as root without being root
# * coreutils: includes `nproc` tool to report number of processors, mktemp
# * bc: allows us to do math to compute sane defaults
# * openssh-client: provides ssh-keygen

# ### Set the system timezone
#
# Some systems are missing /etc/timezone, which we cat into the configs for
# Z-Push and ownCloud, so we need to set it to something. Daily cron tasks
# like the system backup are run at a time tied to the system timezone, so
# letting the user choose will help us identify the right time to do those
# things (i.e. late at night in whatever timezone the user actually lives
# in).
#
# However, changing the timezone once it is set seems to confuse fail2ban
# and requires restarting fail2ban (done below in the fail2ban
# section) and syslog (see #328). There might be other issues, and it's
# not likely the user will want to change this, so we only ask on first
# setup.

# ### Seed /dev/urandom
#
# /dev/urandom is used by various components for generating random bytes for
# encryption keys and passwords:
#
# * TLS private key (see `ssl.sh`, which calls `openssl genrsa`)
# * DNSSEC signing keys (see `dns.sh`)
# * our management server's API key (via Python's os.urandom method)
# * Roundcube's SECRET_KEY (`webmail.sh`)
#
# Why /dev/urandom? It's the same as /dev/random, except that it doesn't wait
# for a constant new stream of entropy. In practice, we only need a little
# entropy at the start to get going. After that, we can safely pull a random
# stream from /dev/urandom and not worry about how much entropy has been
# added to the stream. (http://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/) So we need
# to worry about /dev/urandom being seeded properly (which is also an issue
# for /dev/random), but after that /dev/urandom is superior to /dev/random
# because it's faster and doesn't block indefinitely to wait for hardware
# entropy. Note that `openssl genrsa` even uses `/dev/urandom`, and if it's
# good enough for generating an RSA private key, it's good enough for anything
# else we may need.
#
# Now about that seeding issue....
#
# /dev/urandom is seeded from "the uninitialized contents of the pool buffers when
# the kernel starts, the startup clock time in nanosecond resolution,...and
# entropy saved across boots to a local file" as well as the order of
# execution of concurrent accesses to /dev/urandom. (Heninger et al 2012,
# https://factorable.net/weakkeys12.conference.pdf) But when memory is zeroed,
# the system clock is reset on boot, /etc/init.d/urandom has not yet run, or
# the machine is single CPU or has no concurrent accesses to /dev/urandom prior
# to this point, /dev/urandom may not be seeded well. After this, /dev/urandom
# draws from the same entropy sources as /dev/random, but it doesn't block or
# issue any warnings if no entropy is actually available. (http://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/)
# Entropy might not be readily available because this machine has no user input
# devices (common on servers!) and either no hard disk or not enough IO has
# occurred yet --- although haveged tries to mitigate this. So there's a good chance
# that accessing /dev/urandom will not be drawing from any hardware entropy and under
# a perfect-storm circumstance where the other seeds are meaningless, /dev/urandom
# may not be seeded at all.
#
# The first thing we'll do is block until we can seed /dev/urandom with enough
# hardware entropy to get going, by drawing from /dev/random. haveged makes this
# less likely to stall for very long.

echo "Initializing system random number generator..."
dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=32 2> /dev/null

# This is supposedly sufficient. But because we're not sure if hardware entropy
# is really any good on virtualized systems, we'll also seed from Ubuntu's
# pollinate servers:

pollinate  -q -r

# Between these two, we really ought to be all set.

# We need an ssh key to store backups via rsync, if it doesn't exist create one
if [ ! -f /root/.ssh/id_rsa_miab ]; then

# ### Local DNS Service

# Install a local recursive DNS server --- i.e. for DNS queries made by
# local services running on this machine.
#
# (This is unrelated to the box's public, non-recursive DNS server that
# answers remote queries about domain names hosted on this box. For that
# see dns.sh.)
#
# The default systemd-resolved service provides local DNS name resolution. By default it
# is a recursive stub nameserver, which means it simply relays requests to an
# external nameserver, usually provided by your ISP or configured in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.
#
# This won't work for us for three reasons.
#
# 1) We have higher security goals --- we want DNSSEC to be enforced on all
#    DNS queries (some upstream DNS servers do, some don't).
# 2) We will configure postfix to use DANE, which uses DNSSEC to find TLS
#    certificates for remote servers. DNSSEC validation *must* be performed
#    locally because we can't trust an unencrypted connection to an external
#    DNS server.
# 3) DNS-based mail server blacklists (RBLs) typically block large ISP
#    DNS servers because they only provide free data to small users. Since
#    we use RBLs to block incoming mail from blacklisted IP addresses,
#    we have to run our own DNS server. See #1424.
#
# systemd-resolved has a setting to perform local DNSSEC validation on all
# requests (in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf, set DNSSEC=yes), but because it's
# a stub server the main part of a request still goes through an upstream
# DNS server, which won't work for RBLs. So we really need a local recursive
# nameserver.
#
# We'll install `bind9`, which as packaged for Ubuntu, has DNSSEC enabled by default via "dnssec-validation auto".
# We'll have it be bound to 127.0.0.1 so that it does not interfere with
# the public, recursive nameserver `nsd` bound to the public ethernet interfaces.
#
# About the settings:
#
# * Adding -4 to OPTIONS will have `bind9` not listen on IPv6 addresses
#   so that we're sure there's no conflict with nsd, our public domain
#   name server, on IPV6.
# * The listen-on directive in named.conf.options restricts `bind9` to
#   binding to the loopback interface instead of all interfaces.
# * The max-recursion-queries directive increases the maximum number of iterative queries.
#  	If more queries than specified are sent, bind9 returns SERVFAIL. After flushing the cache during system checks,
#	we ran into the limit thus we are increasing it from 75 (default value) to 100.
apt_install bind9
tools/editconf.py /etc/default/named \
	"OPTIONS=\"-u bind -4\""
if ! grep -q "listen-on " /etc/bind/named.conf.options; then
	# Add a listen-on directive if it doesn't exist inside the options block.

# First we'll disable systemd-resolved's management of resolv.conf and its stub server.
# Breaking the symlink to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf means
# systemd-resolved will read it for DNS servers to use. Put in 127.0.0.1,
# which is where bind9 will be running. Obviously don't do this before
# installing bind9 or else apt won't be able to resolve a server to

# restart at the very end of setup.
