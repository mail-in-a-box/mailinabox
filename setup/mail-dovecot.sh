# Dovecot (IMAP/POP and LDA)
# ----------------------
#
# Dovecot is *both* the IMAP/POP server (the protocol that email applications
# use to query a mailbox) as well as the local delivery agent (LDA),
# meaning it is responsible for writing emails to mailbox storage on disk.
# You could imagine why these things would be bundled together.
#
# As part of local mail delivery, Dovecot executes actions on incoming
# mail as defined in a "sieve" script.
#
# Dovecot's LDA role comes after spam filtering. Postfix hands mail off
# to Spamassassin which in turn hands it off to Dovecot. This all happens
# using the LMTP protocol.

source setup/functions.sh # load our functions
source /etc/mailinabox.conf # load global vars


# Install packages for dovecot. These are all core dovecot plugins,
# but dovecot-lucene is packaged by *us* in the Mail-in-a-Box PPA,
# not by Ubuntu.

# The `dovecot-imapd`, `dovecot-pop3d`, and `dovecot-lmtpd` packages automatically
# enable IMAP, POP and LMTP protocols.

# Set basic daemon options.

# The `default_process_limit` is 100, which constrains the total number
# of active IMAP connections (at, say, 5 open connections per user that
# would be 20 users). Set it to 250 times the number of cores this
# machine has, so on a two-core machine that's 500 processes/100 users).
# The `default_vsz_limit` is the maximum amount of virtual memory that
# can be allocated. It should be set *reasonably high* to avoid allocation
# issues with larger mailboxes. We're setting it to 1/3 of the total
# available memory (physical mem + swap) to be sure.

# Make IMAP IDLE slightly more efficient. By default, Dovecot says "still here"

# bandwidth and number of times the device's networking might be woken up.
# The risk is that if the connection is silent for too long it might be reset
# by a peer. See [#129](https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox/issues/129)

# to run globally for every user before their own sieve files run.
#
# * `sieve_after`: The path to our global sieve directory which can contain .sieve files
# to run globally for every user after their own sieve files run.
#
# * `sieve`: The path to the user's main active script. ManageSieve will create a symbolic
# link here to the actual sieve script. It should not be in the mailbox directory
# (because then it might appear as a folder) and it should not be in the sieve_dir
# (because then I suppose it might appear to the user as one of their scripts).

# is also where the ManageSieve service stores the user's scripts.
