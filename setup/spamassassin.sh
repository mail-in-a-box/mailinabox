# Spam filtering with spamassassin via spampd
# -------------------------------------------
#
# spampd sits between postfix and dovecot. It takes mail from postfix
# over the LMTP protocol, runs spamassassin on it, and then passes the
# message over LMTP to dovecot for local delivery.
#
# In order to move spam automatically into the Spam folder we use the dovecot sieve
# plugin.

source /etc/mailinabox.conf # get global vars
source setup/functions.sh # load our functions

# Install packages and basic configuration
# ----------------------------------------

# Install packages.
# libmail-dkim-perl is needed to make the spamassassin DKIM module work.
# For more information see Debian Bug #689414:
# https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=689414

# Configure pyzor, which is a client to a live database of hashes of
# spam emails. Set the pyzor configuration directory to something sane.
# The default is ~/.pyzor. We used to use that, so we'll kill that old
# directory. Then write the public pyzor server to its servers file.
# That will prevent an automatic download on first use, and also means
# we can skip 'pyzor discover', both of which are currently broken by
# something happening on Sourceforge (#496).

# Configure spampd:
# * Pass messages on to docevot on port 10026. This is actually the default setting but we don't
#   want to lose track of it. (We've configured Dovecot to listen on this port elsewhere.)
# * Increase the maximum message size of scanned messages from the default of 64KB to 500KB, which
#   is Spamassassin (spamc)'s own default. Specified in KBytes.
# * Disable localmode so Pyzor, DKIM and DNS checks can be used.

# Spamassassin normally wraps spam as an attachment inside a fresh
# email with a report about the message. This also protects the user
# from accidentally openening a message with embedded malware.
#
# It's nice to see what rules caused the message to be marked as spam,
# but it's also annoying to get to the original message when it is an
# attachment, modern mail clients are safer now and don't load remote
# content or execute scripts, and it is probably confusing to most users.
#
# Tell Spamassassin not to modify the original message except for adding
# the X-Spam-Status & X-Spam-Score mail headers and related headers.

# Authentication-Results SPF/Dmarc checks
# ---------------------------------------
# OpenDKIM and OpenDMARC are configured to validate and add "Authentication-Results: ..."
# headers by checking the sender's SPF & DMARC policies. Instead of blocking mail that fails
# these checks, we can use these headers to evaluate the mail as spam.
#
# Our custom rules are added to their own file so that an update to the deb package config
# does not remove our changes.
#
# We need to escape period's in $PRIMARY_HOSTNAME since spamassassin config uses regex.

# Bayesean learning
# -----------------
#
# Spamassassin can learn from mail marked as spam or ham, but it needs to be
# configured. We'll store the learning data in our storage area.
#
# These files must be:
#
# * Writable by sa-learn-pipe script below, which run as the 'mail' user, for manual tagging of mail as spam/ham.
# * Readable by the spampd process ('spampd' user) during mail filtering.
# * Writable by the debian-spamd user, which runs /etc/cron.daily/spamassassin.
#
# We'll have these files owned by spampd and grant access to the other two processes.
#
# Spamassassin will change the access rights back to the defaults, so we must also configure
# the filemode in the config file.
