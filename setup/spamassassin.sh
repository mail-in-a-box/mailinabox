# Spam filtering with spamassassin via spampd
# ===========================================
#
# spampd sits between postfix and dovecot. It takes mail from postfix
# over the LMTP protocol, runs spamassassin on it, and then passes the
# message over LMTP to dovecot for local delivery.
#
# In order to move spam automatically into the Spam folder we use the dovecot sieve
# plugin.

source /etc/mailinabox.conf # get global vars
source setup/functions.sh # load our functions

# Install packages and basic configuration
# ----------------------------------------

# Install packages.
apt_install spampd razor pyzor dovecot-antispam

# Allow spamassassin to download new rules.

	CRON=1

# Configure pyzor.
hide_output pyzor discover

# Pass messages on to docevot on port 10026.
# This is actually the default setting but we don't want to lose track of it.
# We've already configured Dovecot to listen on this port.

# Bayesean learning
# -----------------
#
# Spamassassin can learn from mail marked as spam or ham, but it needs to be
# configured. We'll store the learning data in our storage area.
#
# These files must be:
#
# * Writable by sa-learn-pipe script below, which run as the 'mail' user, for manual tagging of mail as spam/ham.
# * Readable by the spampd process ('spampd' user) during mail filtering.
# * Writable by the debian-spamd user, which runs /etc/cron.daily/spamassassin.
#
# We'll have these files owned by spampd and grant access to the other two processes.

# use the Dovecot antispam plugin to detect the message move operation and execute
