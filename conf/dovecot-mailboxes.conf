  # Automatically create & subscribe some folders.
  # * Create and subscribe the INBOX folder.
  # * Our sieve rule for spam expects that the Spam folder exists.
  # * Z-Push must be configured with the same settings in conf/zpush/backend_imap.php (#580).

  # MUA notes:
  # * Roundcube will show an error if the user tries to delete a message before the Trash folder exists (#359).
  # * K-9 mail will poll every 90 seconds if a Drafts folder does not exist.
  # * Apple's OS X Mail app will create 'Sent Messages' if it doesn't see a folder with the \Sent flag (#571, #573) and won't be able to archive messages unless 'Archive' exists (#581).
  # * Thunderbird's default in its UI is 'Archives' (plural) but it will configure new accounts to use whatever we say here (#581).

  # auto:
  # 'create' will automatically create this mailbox.
  # 'subscribe' will both create and subscribe to the mailbox.
